- Added some FIXME's to qm/qmAngularMom.tex.  Review that and qm/bivectorSelect.tex and see if there's an error or just a subtlety that is no longer 
  obvious to me.

- undef references to:

chap:notationTable
chap:PJqmFourier
chap:PJStokes1
chap:PJStokes2

I think I moved the last two to big collection of ... stokes junk collection.

- undef:

eqn:complexFieldEnergy:7

- don't have an index anymore for this collection?
